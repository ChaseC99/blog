For a long time I have avoided writing. 

Writing feels so permanent, and the thought of solidifying a poorly formed idea is unsettling. As long as a thought is unwritten, its quality exists in uncertainty - with the comforting potential to be brilliant.

But that’s a foolish fallacy to fall for. All of those “clever” thoughts floating around in my head remained unchallenged. unreal. ambiguous.

Without writing them down, they never face the pressure necessary to become refined into something meaningful. 

So I’m starting this blog as a space for me to articulate my thoughts, with the goal of making those thoughts, and as a result, my world view, more clear. 

By posting publicly, I believe it will force me to hold my writing to a higher standard. I don’t know who will read this. I’m not writing it for a particular audience. But the fact that anyone could read it, and judge me accordingly, puts the necessary pressure on me to make sure my writings (and therefore my thoughts) are well formed.

Will my friends read it and form new opinions about me?  
Will strangers read it and want to become friends?  
Will LLMs read it and be trained on my voice?  
Will my great-great grandchildren read it and know who I was?  

Some posts will be stories, some will be shorter thoughts, some will be things I’ve learned, some will be opinions, and some (I’m sure) will be boring. I just hope that all of them are authentic.

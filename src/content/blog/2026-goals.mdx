How do you structure your goals?  

Since college, I've taken a theme-of-the-year approach.
* 2023 - Weight Loss
    * Started running, started climbing, got back into volleyball, lost 50 lbs
* 2024 - Side Hustle Revenue
    * Monetized my iOS app, launched an Android app, made $25k
* 2025 - SF Social Life
    * Moved to SF, made a bunch of new friends, met a girl
* 2026 -  ???

General themes are nice but they always felt _a bit vague_. Without clear goals I have been wandering _a bit aimlessly_.
One theme for the year also felt _a bit limiting_. Surely I can focus on more than one theme at a time?

This year, I took a step back to think about what the best version of myself would look like and how I can take specific steps to excel in those areas of my life.

I've picked out 4 different themes. Each theme has some general goals. Each general goal has specific tasks.

My hope is that breaking these down into smaller actionable goals will give me a clear path towards achieving them.

So here is my 2026 ✨_Master Plan_✨, a guiding roadmap for the year ahead.

### Knowledge
The ability to think clearly and articulate my position on a well-rounded variety of topics.
- Read more
    - 1 book / month
    - 7 articles / week
- Write more
    - 1 blog post / week
- Learn more
    - Take an online course

### Creation
Create things that provide value to others, making life easier, simpler, and/or more joyful.
- Portfilio of side projects
    - Start [Carnaroli Software LLC](https://carnaroli.software)
    - Monetize Android version of [QR Me](https://qrme.contact)
    - Launch Blog Log
    - Launch [Sous Kitchen](https://sous.kitchen)
- Share my learnings
    - Write how-to guides
    - [Tweet](https://x.com/chasecarnaroli) tips and tricks for building

### Finance
A solid financial foundation that allows me to fund a life that is meaningful and fulfilling.
- Work towards FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early)
    - Invest 40% of my income
- Financial resilience
    - Maintain a 9 month emergency fund 
    - Establish multiple streams of income (job, side projects, investments)

### Health
A strong and healthy body to do all the things I want to do in life.
- Clear picture of my health metrics
    - Blood draws (2 per year)
    - Body fat % (Dexca scan)
    - Weight (maintain 150-160lbs)
    - Track sleep stats (aim for 7-8 hours per night)
- Run a marathon
    - 1 half marathon / month
    - Create a marathon training plan

I'm really happy with this plan. It targets the important themes that I want to work towards, with clear goals for how to reach them. 

But let's be honest, it's not pretty to look at.

So below, you'll find a bingo board-ified version of my 2026 goals!  
_(plus a few fun bucket list items sprinkled in)_ 

I'll periodically update this board and include a changelog as we make our way through 2026. 

Wishing you a Happy New Year and the best of luck with your goals 🎉
